Two types of testing: 
	Manual- Testing functionality by hand
	Automated- Testing using a coded test suite

Tests are NOT a way that to show that your code is correct. 

Testing methods:
	Black Box- testing without knowing what the code looks like
	White Box- testing internal structures or inner workings of a program instead of its functionality. Testing actual code

Funcitonal Testing: Testing features and that it is meeting goals of application

Non-Functional: tests target performance, resource utilization, usability, compatibility
	-Load testing
	-Security
	-Usability

Unit Tests
	Tests individual methods in a class independant of dependancies

Integration Tests
	Tests whether bits of code(methods, classes, modules, componenets) can work together

Funtcional and Acceptance Tests
	Check that a particular feature works


Public vs Private methods

Private method cannot be called from outside the object. ie A method within the class/object can use the method, but any object outside of this method cannot access it.
